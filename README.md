# local-library
A Local Library website written in Express (Node.js). This project is meant to replicate a system that a library would use to keep track of which books they have available, as well as any books that are currently checked our or on loan.
This project could easily be converted to be used in a private setting in order to keep track of the books you have in your own library whether that be digitally(kindle, etc) or physically(hardcover, comics, etc). 

To set up this project locally for private use,

After you have downloaded all the packages and dependencies, you will need to open up the app.js file in the root and find the variable "*dev_db_url*". Currently, it is set to a value of "*placeholder*", you will need to replace that value with your Mongodb database URI credential. Now you can run the program and your site should be running on <http://localhost:3000/>.
